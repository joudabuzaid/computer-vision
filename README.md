This program does the following:
1) read the attached image "testImage.jpg".
2) resize it so that its size is (16x16). 
3) convert it to gray scale.
4) convert every pixel value to 0 if it is less than 100. 
5) display all pixel values of Img in the matrix form on the screen. 
6) find the x-derivative fx and y-derivative fy of Img.
7) display all pixel values of both derivates in the matrix form on the screen.
8) find gradient magnitude of fx and fy
9) display both gradient magnitude and direction in the matrix form on the screen. 
10) find non-maximal suppression of gradient magnitude.
11) display the output of above step in the matrix form on the screen. 
12) apply hysterisis thresholding on the above output.
13) display both the above output in the matrix form on the screen.
