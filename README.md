The main goal of this assignment is to apply geometric transformation. This program should do the following:
1) take the input image and display it
2) waits for the user to click at any 4 points on the image (to capture any object)
3) then apply geometric transformation (affine as well as perspective) to extract the object (as 4 points clicked by the user) and bring it up front.
